# S.P.A.S.H. Source Code

Arduino C++ code for S.P.L.A.S.H. (Self-Powered Lid, Automatically Shutting Hub), a device which automatically opens and closes public toilet lids based on user presence to improve sanitation in public restrooms by containing the spread of aerosolized fecal matter in toilet bowls after flushing. Relies on existing touchless flushing mechanism and utilizes an Arduino Nano, brushless DC motor, and ultrasonic sensor to detect users and operate toilet lids.
